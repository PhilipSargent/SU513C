Andrew Waddington's cave survey reduction program.

The documentation is in SURVEY.GUIDE.CC

The pen-plotting routines were originally written at UKAEA and then ported
to use CAMPLOT in Cambridge in 1983 by Philip Sargent. 

The Phoenix scripts to run the fortran job are also uploaded here.
The software was used in the early years of the Cambridge University 
Caving Club (CUCC) annual expedition to Austria, see
